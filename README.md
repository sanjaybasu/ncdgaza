Purpose: Palestinians in Gaza have among the highest rates of non-communicable disease (NCD) in the world, yet ongoing conflicts have limited interventions to high-yield blood pressure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia treatments. We sought to assist in comparing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of potential new public health and healthcare NCD risk reduction efforts among Palestinians in Gaza.


Methods: We created and applied a microsimulation model using: (i) a cross-sectional household survey providing information about baseline characteristics and NCD risk factors among 4,576 Palestinian adults aged 40 years old and above in Gaza; (ii) a modified Delphi process for local public health experts to identify potentially feasible new interventions for NCD risk reduction in Gaza; and (iii) systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention effectiveness, with modifications for the Gazan and refugee contexts. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Al-Quds University and Imperial College London.
